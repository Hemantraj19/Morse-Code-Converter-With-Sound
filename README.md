# Morse Code Converter with Sound

This Python script allows you to encode and decode messages in Morse code. It also provides an option to play the Morse code as sound using pygame.

## Usage

1. Run the script.
2. Choose an option:
   - Enter '1' to encode your message to Morse code.
   - Enter '2' to decode Morse code to text.
   - Enter '3' to exit the program.

## Functions

### 1. Encode Message to Morse Code

- Input: Takes user input for the text to be converted to Morse code.
- Output: Displays the Morse code and provides an option to play the Morse code as sound.

### 2. Decode Morse Code to Message

- Input: Takes user input for the Morse code to be decoded.
- Output: Prints the original text and plays the sound.

### 3. Exit Program

- Input: Exits the program when the user enters '3'.

## Requirements

- Python
- pygame library (for playing Morse code sound)

## Sound Files

The script uses 'dot.wav' and 'dash.wav' sound files for playing Morse code sounds. Make sure these files are present in the same directory as the script.

Feel free to customize the sound files or use your own.

## Note

Ensure that you have the required sound files and the pygame library installed before running the script.
